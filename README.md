## Emailer :octocat:

<sub>ANOTHER AUTOMATION SCRIPT FOR A 3 MINUTE TASK ðŸ™€</sup>

CML Tool for sending emails to specific recipients - a script written in python

*applicants.csv*: this is a csv file which stores all the recipents - currently, it's still manual, but it would be better if the data is synced with Google Sheet. 

*jsonfile.json*: json file to store all the letters

*json_writer.py*: a module written for *send_email.py*

send_email.py: this is the main script of the code.
`python3 send_email.py` or `./send_email.py` to get started.

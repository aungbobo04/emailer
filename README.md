# emailer

cml tool for sending emails to specific recipients - a script written in python

applicants: this is a csv file which stores all the recipents - currently, it's still manual and it would be better if the data is sync with Google Sheet. 

jsonfile.json: json file to store all the letters

json_writer.py: a module written for *send_email.py*

send_email.py: this is the main script of the code. `python3 send_email.py` or `./send_email.py` to get started.
